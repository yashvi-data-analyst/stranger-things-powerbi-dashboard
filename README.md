🧪 What I Learned from the Upside Down

This project helped me understand that:

Analytics is not only about numbers ➕➖

Visuals + story = impact 💥

Even as a learner, you can build portfolio-ready dashboards

Like Eleven 🩸 — you don’t need to be perfect,
you just need to trust your power and keep experimenting 🚀

✨ Inspiration

Inspired by Stranger Things and the belief that

Data can tell stories as powerful as any series. 🎥📊
